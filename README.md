You should build a simple web page that takes client’s input as number and calculates square root of it with precision to n decimal places where client selects the precision (could be from a pull down menu or a button or in other way).  When calculating the square root, you should not use any function call, library, or a third party function but rather calculate it using only operations of +, -, *, and /. 
 

You will not need to be completely familiar with finance to complete this exercise.  However, you should know that stocks have a price, and the price moves around as the market moves around. 
 

You are to build a demo web page that could display prices of three stocks:  MS, AAPL, and AMZN.  You may know them as Morgan Stanley, Apple, and Amazon, respectively.  The web page could either generate the random small price changes with the following restrictions: Each price will be rounded to the penny (0.01); prices shall vary within a range as follows, or use a delayed market data source if available (this requires a little bit more knowledge):

                                                               i.      MS:  between 70 and 90.00

                                                             ii.      AAPL:  between 170.00 and 220.00

                                                           iii.      AMZN:  between 120.00 and 160.00

The prices should change with reasonably small increments, with update frequency at most once per second. 

Challenge task: inspired by top of our company’s landing page at www.tradingblock.com and by our virtual trading platform https://vt.tradingblock.com , build  a simple one screen web page looking alike ours but with quoted prices on it changing (no need to use market data).
